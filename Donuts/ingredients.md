For this recipe you’ll only need 7 basic ingredients which you may already have. You’ll need:

All-purpose flour: I like to use unbleached flour but bleached will work fine too.
Baking powder: This helps the donuts puff up, don’t skip it.
Salt: Just use standard table salt. Nothing special here.
Buttermilk: I don’t recommend substitutes here, the milk and vinegar substitute isn’t quite thick enough.
Granulated sugar: You’ll add this to both the donut dough and use for rolling.
Melted butter: This adds a delicious flavor to the donuts. Stick with real butter.
Vegetable oil: Needed for frying.

If you’d like to cover the donuts in classic vanilla glaze* then you could mix (and spoon over):

3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 1/2 Tbsp milk
1/2 tsp vanilla
*For chocolate glaze just add 2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder to the mixture above.

Then you can finish them as you like. I just go the sugar route but you can also cover them with:

vanilla donut glaze
chocolate icing
cinnamon sugar or pumpkin spice sugar
powered sugar
